    type: 'PRISM Library',
    notes: "+ We've gone all meta and given ourselves a home as the first release. The Ops of Ops is the first topic in the PRISM Library.<br/>Not because we don't care about anyone else, but because if you're going to test on someone and it isn't going to be pretty, it doesn't hurt to test it on yourself.<br/>We've made a special group, the ReOps Team, and we are testing permissions and adding governance tags to the back end of the library. All boring stuff until you don't have it. Bit like making sure your first meal of the day has stuff in it that keeps your body happy, is governance to research."

    version: '0.1.3',
    type: 'PRISM Library',
    notes: "The PRISM Library now has a home as well! As with PRISM Groups, the library has no structure as yet.<br/>+ Every piece of research has its place. Once we have some structure, we will quickly add Topic Page views and Showcase views for you to showcase your research.<br/>+ Don't forget to send us your research artefacts when you are done. Get your approvals in place, and let us know if you have opinions about how it should be viewed.<br/>+ Once we have some structure in here, we will add the Division to the library so you can access research anytime."

    type: 'Research Register',
    notes: "PRISM Groups now hosts the Research Register. Add your planned research by clicking the 'new' button <br/> + View the research happening as a calendar view, or chose a spreadsheet view and filter by commodity, team, date, research method, stage in the SDDP"

    date: 'Oct 15, 2021',
    version: '0.1.1',
    type: 'PRISM Groups',
    notes: "The PRISM Groups site now has governed document libraries for research teams.<br/>+ We haven't made any structure inside the libraries, but baby steps, eh? Thanks to the Web and Design team who spent extra time with the ReOps team to make sure we knew what we were doing.<br/>+ Next time you do some research, sing out and we will hook you up. The experience is now nicer than it was in just the Teams site because we are customising pages for viewing your research data collection for editing like airtable."
