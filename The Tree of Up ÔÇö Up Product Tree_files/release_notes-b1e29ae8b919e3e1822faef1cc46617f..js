Now send FJD to friends and family living in the Soft Coral Capital of the World.<br/>+ A brutish bug was pushing some peoples passcode keyboards up in one corner.

Set the rules and we'll automatically split your pay day cash between your Savers, and both your solo and 2Up spending accounts. Will you split off a small portion of pay, or set sail the fattest of stacks? The decision on that divide rests with you.<br/>+ More wrist related improvements means you can now view your 2Up spending activity, check on shared Trackers, and tap into 2Up card controls all on watchOS."

Get notifications throughout the month with personalised updates on how your Trackers are… tracking. Stress less, we won't put you on blast for a budget blow out.<br/>+ Don't get floored by figures.

Find your delete key by tapping the options icon in a payment thread. But take care - once that history is gone, it’s gone forever.<br/>+ We improved some open spaces and screen heights, and freshened the emojis up a bit.
